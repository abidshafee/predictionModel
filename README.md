### predictionModel
This web app, built using the Streamlit library, leverages a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on user input information. The app has been successfully deployed to the Streamlit live server. Currently in the development stage, we are actively working on adding more features and functionality to enhance the user experience. Feel free to try out the app and provide feedback.
Try the app [here](https://predictionmodel.streamlit.app/) while I am developing it.
